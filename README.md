# no_sql_challenge
In this challenge I evaluated restauruant ratings across the UK.

Part 1
 First I imported the json data file to mongoDB using my command line.

Part 2
  I updated the database and added a new restauraunt "Penang Flavors", then found the correct buisness id to ensure they correspond

  I removed all data from Dover and updated the database.

Part 3
I created queries to pull out restauraunts with a specific hygeine rating. I then turned this data into a dataframe using pandas.
